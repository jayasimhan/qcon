##Apache Mesos

Distributed operating system

Master/Slave architecture

One master is elected among themselves as master. If a master fails another Master is chosen.


at the core of Mesos is

* libprocess
  - async message processing library
* master
  - couple of masters. One of them is elected a leader.
* Slave
* Framework

Slaves
1. Slaves execute tasks whichs are submitted by framekworks

System resources are allocated to slaved.

Mesos Frameworks
- Hadoop
  * Batch processing
- Storm  
  * Stream processing framework
  * Realtime processing for what Hadoop does for Batch processing
- Chronos 
  * Task Scheduler. Its like a distributed cron.
- Aurora
  * Service frmakework to run long running services, for example run web services
- Marathon
  * Runing services similar to Aurora.
  * More like a meta framework
#### Marathon
Marathon can be used like a meta framework. You can run other frameworks using Marathon. So you can use marathon to start a bunch of marathons.

nginx watches zookeeper config that redirects requests to slaves
